# Shallowslept: a Minecraft Modpack with medieval-fantasy flair

The modpack focuses on Vanilla-esque gameplay (no intrusion of steep learning curve mechanics), with enhanced combat and character progression.
The pack currently uses Minecraft 1.20.1 as a base, Forge as the modloader and included Sinytra Connector + FFAPI for some Fabric mod support.
